## Profile
I'm a software engineer who's excited about great UX and clean code. I enjoy helping people, sharing knowledge and solving problems. Most of my experience is in the FE with React, but I happily take on any technical challenge.

## Experience

__eBay, Staff Engineer__

Worked with Java/Kotlin in Spring(MVC | Boot)/Android, Swift in iOS and JS/TS in React/Marko. Most proud about architecting the eBay shipping web app (in React) and the native shipping experience service (in Kotlin).
