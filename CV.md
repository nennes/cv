## Profile
I'm a software engineer who's excited about great UX and clean code. I enjoy a culture of helping people, sharing knowledge and delivering valuable and maintainable products. Most of my experience is in the FE with React, but I happily take on any technical challenge.

## Experience

`Jan 2023 - Present`
__[Dojo](https://dojo.tech), Software Engineer__

Making Dojo [RMS](https://rms.walkup.co) (restaurant management system) simpler and more powerful, using React/GraphQL and Golang. Most proud about consolidating 3 dashboards into a unified experience, with improved UI and features.

`Aug 2022 - Jan 2023`
__[Ziglu](https://www.ziglu.io), Staff Engineer__

Faced with the challenge of an overcomplicated ReactNative app, I proposed and lead the initiative to introduce a shim service. I integrated it with the event-driven BE architecture and introduced GraphQL to push updates to the app. Unfortunately the Robinhood aquisition was cancelled, and most employees were made redundant.

`May 2016 - Jul 2022`
__[eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk), Member of Technical Staff__

Built fantastic eBay experiences! Worked with Java/Kotlin in Spring(MVC | Boot)/Android, Swift in iOS and JS/TS in React/[Marko](https://markojs.com). Most proud about architecting the eBay [shipping web app](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-print-shipping-label-on-ebay) (in TS/React/Redux/Reselect) and the native shipping experience service (in Kotlin/SpringBoot). Created and released multiple internal tools, mentored and managed junior developers. Worked closely with POs and designers to ensure that we build the right features the right way.

`Apr 2017 - Dec 2018`
__[CodeYourFuture](https://codeyourfuture.io), Mentor__

Volunteered to enable refugees change their future through web development training and career coaching. Taught part of the curriculum, helped with 1:1 coding sessions and guided many through their successful interview journey.

`Oct 2012 - May 2016`
__[Fivium](https://www.fivium.co.uk), Application Developer__

Developed and maintained complex workflow-based systems for the UK government. Heavily used Oracle SQL, PL/SQL (for all the business logic) and XML (see [FOXopen framework](http://www.foxopen.net)). Designed and built a report generation web application, which collected production data from multiple DBs, combined them, applied statistical calculations and allowed for generating PDF reports (using Jasper templates).


## Education
